# CUIoT
This repository hosts the implementation of Cu‑IoT, an approximate‑matching algorithm designed to identify IoT devices from network traffic captures. Unlike machine‑learning solutions, Cu‑IoT requires no feature extraction or training phase, simplifying deployment in forensic and incident‑response scenarios. Evaluated on three real‑world IoT datasets—covering active, setup, and idle device states.

These results demonstrate Cu‑IoT’s efficiency and effectiveness compared to both ML‑based and other hash‑based approaches, making it a valuable tool for fast, reliable IoT device identification in network forensic contexts .

The Trace that CUIoT was evaluated on can be found here: https://iotanalytics.unsw.edu.au/iottraces.html
